      <p>I posted on Sulekha that I'm looking for training and placement later I got a call from SytelInfo person Rishi (+1 210-920-3223) who said to pay <em>800$ for Training and Placement</em> as below</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div> 
      <p>After paying 100$ initially I got Welcome email stating how the process will be done and the payment <em>800$ will be reimbursed in first month salary </em>after placement in a project. The resume preparation, mock interviews and everything else will be taken care by them. He assured us the placement is a piece of cake</p>

    <div>
      <p>Received training info which will be given by a 3rd party person, the marketing people said he will be doing one on one <em> but to my surprise it was a batch</em></p>

    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Once the payments and trainings are done <em>I have to chase them for everything </em>starting from Resume preparation. The team requested us to prepare and share instead of them doing, we obliged and later they said it looks good and next step is interviews </p>

      <p>I got my first interview email with Deloitte remote position, the interview will be a telephonic call after the first round the next was HR. we completed that too and I have to followup continuously over the next few months to get the status update. After 2 to 3 months it was said to be onhold.</p>

      <br>
      <p>There is no updates from SytelInfo unless we reach out and the constant answer what we get is no update from client yet. This whole followup process took 3 months</p>

After 2 months it was said to be onhold.</p>

      <p>when I wexed up with this followups I requested my money to be reimbursed. The offer they made is 200$ to which I disagreed as I put more efforts in this than Sytelinfo, lastly I went with half amount which is also keep dragging on. Finally placing this site with my experience.</p>
